Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: Initializing creates a new repository. You need to do it whenever you need to create a new repository in a directory.

Q; How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: The staging area holds files before fully commiting. You can add ("git add") multiple files to staging, and then commit all at once. Useful if one feature required updates to multiple files--you could add each file to staging, and then commit all at once for one reason.
